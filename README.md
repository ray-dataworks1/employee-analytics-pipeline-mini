# Employee Data Pipeline Mini Project
A beginner-friendly, end-to-end pipeline in Python that creates, saves, and transforms employee data using CSV files.
Perfect for learning data engineering basics and getting comfortable with automation!

## Overview
This mini project demonstrates how to:

Create your own structured dataset in Python

Save the data as a CSV file (Comma-Separated Values)

Read and filter the CSV (e.g., by age, department, or salary)

Set up your pipeline for automation and future scaling

You’ll practice both “data-in, data-out” workflows and essential skills for real-world projects:

Python scripting

Debugging

Modularity, clean code and production ready skills

Writing a README (like this!)

Facing the learning curve head-on (with style)

## Project Structure

## How It Works
Creates employee data in Python as a list of dictionaries

Saves the data to employee_data.csv using the standard csv library

(Optional: Add your own filters!)

## Getting Started

1. Clone or Download This Repo
For Bash/Shell scripters: 
git clone https://github.com/ray-dataworks1/pipeline_automation_mini_project.git
cd pipeline_automation_mini_project/data

3. Run the Pipeline
Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

python pipeline_creation_and_automation_script.py
You should see a message:
Employee data has been written to employee_data.csv

## How to Customize
Edit the data list in the script to add your own employees, fields, or values.

Try reading or filtering the CSV (e.g., print only “Engineering” employees or those earning over £60,000).

Practice adding more steps: data validation, new fields, or integration with Bash or other tools.

## Why This Project Exists

“Do it scared, and it’ll get easier!”
This project is for anyone who feels intimidated by code, automation, or “being seen” as a learner.
Progress > Perfection.

## Next Steps & Ideas
Automate with a Bash script or cron job

Visualise employee data (e.g., salary by department)

Extend to read from an API or save to a database

Refactor into functions or classes as you learn

## License
MIT (or whatever you like—just edit as needed)
